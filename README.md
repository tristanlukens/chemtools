## Credits

For data concerning the periodic table (atomic mass etc), [a JSON periodic table on GitHub](https://github.com/Bowserinator/Periodic-Table-JSON) is used.

The `argparse` python module is used to define commands. The `subcommand` decorator and `argument` function from [this blogpost by Mike Depaltis](https://mike.depalatis.net/blog/simplifying-argparse.html) are a fantastic way to streamline its usage.
